# OpenRAMT

## Introduction

This program aims to be an open source Remote Admin and Monitoring Tool. It will provide (at least at first) basic remote management features and functionality and will offer all that in a cross platform manor. It should do so in a secure manor with user groups in mind to limit sensitive functionality on deployment to shared users.

## Milestones
There will be 4 Milestones
- Base UI complete - Most of the UI has been completed, including all of the critical UI parts. Some UI might not be functionaly complete but has a baseline completed.
- Base Functionality Complete - The functionality has been most complete and brought up to a functionable state. It may not be perfect but it will be worked upon with further milestones.
- Beta Release Candidate - Progress out of an alpha state and close to a release state. This milestone provides a candidate that will should be complete but hasn't been extensively tested.
- Release Candidate - This milestone will give a finished product that has all aspects introduced fully developed and has been tested for bugs and patched to a final worthy state.
